When someone creates a category named `Micky` or `Suggestions`, they will be lead to adding the following channel called `suggestions`. That channel is where all the suggestions are lead. Then they will be also be asked to create a channel called `sumbit-siggestions`. This is where people sumbit their suggestions with the command `?suggest [suggestion]`. For more information, say `?help`.
