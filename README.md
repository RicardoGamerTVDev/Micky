## How Does Micky Work?

When someone creates a category named `Micky` or `Suggestions`, they will be lead to adding the following channel called `suggestions`. That channel is where all the suggestions are lead. Then they will be also be asked to create a channel called `sumbit-siggestions`. This is where people sumbit their suggestions with the command `?suggest [suggestion]`. For more information, say `?help`.

## What commands will be added?

Some commands may have errors while trying. If you do get an error, or the bot is down. Do not worry. Because it’s just me editing the bot will adding some commands. I will be adding `?acceptsuggestion [@user]` so people know that their suggestion has been added to the most amazing server. I will try to add `?declinesuggestion [@user]` as well so people know that their suggestion wasn’t accepted.
